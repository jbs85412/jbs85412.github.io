We have traveled there with many different people like our extended family, friends, even my soccer and volleyball teams for tournaments.<br> Our normal vacation spot is Santa Rosa Beach, Florida which is on the panhandle of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico. It is beteen Destin and Panama City Beach and has the clearest waters and the whitest sand. It is a beautiful and fun place that my family and I will go to for a long time.</p></td>              <td><img src="FlordiaBeach.jpg" alt="Flordia" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></td>              </tr>            </table>            <table>              <tr class="Para1">              <td><img src="GoldenGateBridge.jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" style="width:304px;height:228px;"></td><td style="text-align:center"><div><B>CALIFORNIA</B></div><p style="text-align:Left">My sister and I went to California this spring break to visit one of our good friends.
